	(preon)		Yep, that's the one. My 'client' wants me to loot their Diamonds. He also wants them all dead.
	(captain)	He's in the ship ! Lock the cargo doors !!
	(captain)	Wait.. you look familiar. Are you Preonidas ?
	(preon)		It's CAPTAIN Preonidas.
	(captain)	You're the ex-neoSpartan Veteran with the 'Deadly' pilot rating, and the 500K bounty !!
	(preon)		Eye ! Arghhh !
	(captain)	Look, we want no trouble! No need to risk our lives. Besides, we're practically unarmed.
	(preon)		Uh - um, that's very nice. Could you please gather in one place, so I can give an autograph to everyone ? 
	(preon)		(Crap, I hoped they would have some spare ammo cause I'm running out, and I gotta kill the whole crew).
	(captain)	Everybody, go and throw your weapons into space, and go hide somewhere. He doesn't have enough ammo to kill you all!
	(preon)		WTF dude, how did you hear that ?
	(preon)		Okay, I think I got it, but I'll have to watch my ammo. I'll have to make each shot count.
		
	(preon)		They're all dead. Let's get the diamonds and get the hell out of here
	(preon)		I got all the Diamonds. But there's someone still alive in the ship. I must leave no witnesses.
	(preon)		Diammonds.. check. Crew dead.. check. Yep, I'm done here, lets go back to my ship

	Let's start with the acrobatics test. Use key key[jump] to jump.
	Next test is Shooting Skill. Hit key[shoot] to shoot. We left some ammo for you, it should be enough.
	Hit key[interact] to interact with controls like Switches and Levers. Make sure to stand in front of them.

	This is the final test: Zero Gravity movement. Use the gravity switches to disable and re-enable gravity.

	Whew! That was close!! The Cryokolis Agents will not follow me here. You see, I did the "Mad Vlad" trick, it includes sabotaging your hyperdrive while doing an intergalactic hyperjump.
	Practically, it sends you to a random System, so noone can follow you. So you'll definitely lose whoever is chasing you. This is the good part.
	The bad thing, is that you find yourself in an unknown, possibly desserted system, with a failing hyperdrive. If you can't fix it, you'll die in that system.
	I'm not the first human visiting this system. During the 6th Intergalactic War, a great battle took place here, and now the  whole place is full of shipwrecks
	If I'm lucky, I might find some spare parts to repair my hyperdrive and get the Hell out of here.

	<!-- 
	(Lt Karmiris personal log)
	Yesterday we left Theta Moularis, on our way to Kappa Saliaris. We're supposed to meet the rest of the Imperial Forces and head to battle the Arctanians.
	All of our crew are both excited and scared. For the most of us, it's not out first time to the batlefield, but the Arctanians are not to be under-estimated. 
	We believe that we have better chances to win, but then again.. any soldier believes so. Your enemy too.. 
	
	We're lucky having such a brave and experienced Captain. Cpt Mitros is the type of the leader that anyone respects, and relies on. He's so influential.
	When you are in panic and doubt, cpt Mitros has the ability to give you orders in such a way, that will override your insticts and do things that you would normally refuse to do.
	And you find yourself back on your feet fighting. Ready to sacrifice yourself. Like a war machine. Like a fighter. Like a soldier.
	We all feel like we want to prove ourselves to him. To earn his respect. Be a part of his victories. Help him write the history. He's a hero.
	And he's such a nice guy, friendly, modest, generous, righteous. He's irreplaceable. I hope he never dies.
	I don't want to die either, but is my life as valuable as his ? Hey what the fuck am I thinking, this can't be normal.
	
	
	We lost a lot of time travelling through some systems. We won't make it to Kappa Saliaris on time. Unless we take a shortcut.
	It's decided. In 5 minutes we're warping to.. wait for it.. Gamma F**ing Infernis. Yeah I know. We've been hearing stories about it like forever.
	God, I hope I'll survive this war. The stories I'll be telling..
	
	I gotta admit, Gamma Infernis is as creepy as it sounds. Normally we would have stayed there only 5 minutes, the minimum time needed to prepare the next warp jump.
	But we needed one guy to get out of the ship to remove a small comet piece that jammed our hyperdrive's radar. Guess who did that. If you guessed Cpt Mitros, you're right.
	During these agonizing 30 minutes, we all witnessed weird shit. Ships lights went randomly on/off, screechy sounds from the hull, animal screams etc.
	Some guys even hallucinated. Maybe I did too. Not sure. While looking at the flares of Infernis sun, I swear I saw a goat's face. And a pentagram. Oh, and a school bus too
	But maybe we were all ovewhelmed from the stories we knew. Could it be the hype making ourselves making up things ? 
	If I ever become a millionaire, I'll make a tourist resort here. Hell of an investment lol.
	
	Not much time to write. Reached Saliaris. Met the Imperials. Battle in 15 mins. Gods help us
	
	Back alive. We won. Took captives too. Gotta rest. Change pants too.
	
	We had another battle in Glychie 7895 B. Great battle. Hundrends of ships. the Arctanians have fully retreated. Maybe this war is close to it's end.
	
	Mitros went over himself today. He took a captive and threw him to a room with a tiny hull hole. His back was sucked to the roof. For 3 minutes our ship was spraying blood like an Earth whale
	Mitros was laughing and chanted something in Latin. He was trying to cheer us up, a reward for our brave battle. But I feel discussed. That poor Arctanian guy...
	Today Mitros punished a poor guy that fled in the battle. He left the guy in space, wearing the upper body suit only. Said he didn't deserve to have balls.
	Ok, Mitros is not the Captain I knew. He's so bad. in a bad way of bad. Not cool bad, just bad. Evil!
	
	Today cpt Mitros walked through the ship naked. He ripped off a joystick from the cockpit, some knives from the kitchen, and a grease can from the engine room. Then he grabbed a captive and took him to his cabin.
	cpt Mitros is locked in his cabin for days now. He only left his room once to get some scalpels from the med room. I don't want to imagine what he's doing to the poor guy.
	We saw him for the first time after 10 days. He has a pair of horns on his head and his knees bend backwards. Some medics tried to examine him. We never saw them again.
	
	cpt Mitros got angry with a guy that was staring at his horns. He took him to the engine room and stuck his head in the hyperdrive engine. That was totaly gross, and unjustified.
	Plus we don't have an angine anymore. We're stucked in Glychie, with an insane captain. What could worse.
	
	Mitros has clearly got out of his mind. He's dangerous. Now he's killing anyone just for fun. Our crew decided to take action. A late action let me tell you.
	Today we're gonna put him to the brig. It will be him against the whole crew. He's tough but I don't think he can take us all. Plus, we know that he has no weapons in his cabin. Except for the scalpels
	
	Our 'mutiny' attempt was a total disaster. Almost anyone is dead. I managed to get away while he was slaughtering the poor guys. I'm hidden in an air duct
	I'm starving, can't stay hidden forever. I'm going out to face him. I know I don't have a chance, but nothing makes sense anyway. I don't wanna be alive anymore.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	I feel a bit weird here. It's hard to explain.. I better get done quickly with this place and get the hell out of here.
	Wait, what's that weird guy, down there, boy he's huge.

	Oops he saw me

1914 translation by H. Rackham

"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, 
so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; 
and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. 
These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. 
In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. 
But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. 
The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
