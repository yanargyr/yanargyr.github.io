It terminates the tenancy immediately and cataclysmically, nullifying all contractual obligations and obliterating the tenant's existence, without prior notice, in an extraordinary measure to minimize the risk of financial loss or potential property devaluation and ensure cosmic stability.

	<!--
	Captain, have you ever heard of HMS Queen Lilith ?
	Sure, the Imperial Battleship that was never found. What about it?
	While it survived the last battle in the Intergalactic War III, it never returned to it's base and..
	blah blah, what about it..

	Looks like we've found it. Actually, you're really close.
	No way!!!
	It's hull is in good shape. Chances are it had a fatal engine and communication failure.


	Is there any way there we'll find any survivors?
	That ship had no Cryogen chambers, and it's been 243 earth years after the ship's transmission. There's no way anyone could survive that long.

	Lt Karmiris personal log #1
	Yesterday we left Theta Moularis, on our way to Delta Vitta 8795. We're supposed to meet the rest of the Imperial Forces and head to battle the Arctanians.
	We're so lucky having such a brave and experienced Captain leading us. Cpt Mejarr is the type of the leader that anyone respects, and relies on. He's so influential.

	bigshipLogs_2
	We've lost a lot of time travelling through some systems. We won't make it to Kappa Saliaris on time. Unless we take a shortcut.
	It's decided. In 5 minutes we're warping to.. wait for it.. Gamma F***ing Infernis. Yeah I know. We've been hearing stories about it since we were little kids.
	God, I hope I'll survive this war. The stories I'll be telling..

	bigshipLogs_3
	I gotta admit, Gamma Infernis is as creepy as it sounds. Normally we would have stayed there for only 5 minutes, until our next hyperjump.
	But a small comet piece got stuck in our radar motor, and we needed someone to get out of the ship and remove it. Guess who did that. If you guessed Cpt Mejarr, you're right.
	During the 30 agonizing minutes Mejarr was out, we have all witnessed some weird shit. Ships lights went randomly on/off, screechy sounds coming from the hull, animal screams etc.
	Some guys even hallucinated. Maybe I did too. Not sure. While looking at the flares of Infernis sun, I swear I saw a goat's face.


	//Not much time to write. Reached Saliaris. Met the Imperials. Battle in 15 mins. Gods help us
	//Back alive. We won. Took captives too. Gotta rest. Change pants too.
	//We had another battle in Tau Iota 3319. Great battle. Hundrends of ships. the Arctanians have fully retreated. Maybe this war is close to it's end.

	bigshipLogs_4
	We've reached Saliaris 3 days ago and jumped right into the battle. We're alive and got some captives too
	The Arctanians have fully retreated, and are in our way to home. But I have more things to worry about now. It's about captain Mejarr..
	See, Mejarr went over himself today. He took a captive and threw him into a room with a small hull hole. The valuum sucked his back on roof and for 3 minutes our ship was spraying blood.
	Mejarr was laughing and chanting something in Latin.

	bigshipLogs_5
	Last week, Mejarr punished a poor guy that fled in the battle. He left the guy in space, wearing only his upper body suit. Said he didn't deserve to have balls.
	Next day, he walked through the ship naked. He ripped off a joystick from the cockpit, some knives from the kitchen, and a grease can from the engine room. Then he grabbed a captive and took him to his cabin.
	Cpt Mejarr is locked in his cabin for days now. Except one time, when he left his room, to get some scalpels from the Med room. I don't want to imagine what he's doing to the poor guy.

	bigshipLogs_6
	We saw Mejarr again, for the first time after 10 days. He has a pair of horns on his head and his knees bend backwards. A doctor was staring at the horns.
	Mejarr didn't appreciate the doc's interest, and took her to the engine room and stuck her head in the hyperdrive engine. That was totaly gross, messy, and unjustified.
	Plus we don't have an angine anymore. We're stucked in Tau Iota 3319, with an insane captain. What could go worse?

	bigshipLogs_7
	Mejarr is clearly out of his mind. Everybody agrees that he's dangerous, killing anyone just for fun. Our crew decided to take action. A late action let me tell you.
	Today we're going to capture him and put him in the brig. It will be him against the whole crew. He's tough but I don't think he can take us all.

	bigshipLogs_8
	Our 'mutiny' attempt was a total disaster. Almost anyone is dead. I managed to get away while he was slaughtering the poor guys. I'm hidden in an air duct
	I'm starving, can't stay hidden forever. I'm going out to face him. I know I don't have a chance, but nothing makes sense anyway. I don't wanna be alive anymore.

1914 translation by H. Rackham

"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue;
and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.
But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.
The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.

	This portal gives me the chills. I better get done quickly with this place and get the hell out of here.
